# E-commerce Risk Assessment

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

I have recently joined the cybersecurity team at an e-commerce company that stores data on a remote database server. With many employees working from various locations worldwide, the company relies on this server for accessing customer information. However, the database has been publicly accessible since the company's launch three years ago, and as a cybersecurity analyst, I understand that this poses a significant security risk.

My current assignment is to conduct a vulnerability assessment to highlight the potential dangers of keeping the server open to the public. I will need to prepare a detailed report that outlines how this vulnerability impacts business operations and proposes methods to enhance the security of the database.

The risk analysis in this report is guided by the principles outlined in NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1.
