# 🛡️ Incident Response: DDoS Attack

## 📘 Overview

I am a cybersecurity analyst at a multimedia company that provides web design, graphic design, and social media marketing services to small businesses. Recently, the organization experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that disrupted operations and compromised the internal network.

In response to this incident, I’ve been tasked with developing a plan to improve the company’s network security using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) as a guide.
